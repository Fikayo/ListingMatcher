To run the program
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the directory
3. run "java -jar sortable.jar" on the terminal (Ensure that sortable.jar is in the same folder as the 'res' folder)

The output files can be found in the 'out' directory (one will be created if it does not already exist).
   
Enjoy :)
